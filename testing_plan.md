### Unit Test Example: Payment Verification

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_crypto_payment_verification():
    # Arrange
    payment_manager = PaymentManager()
    mock_transaction = "0x123456789abcdef"
    expected_result = True
    
    # Act
    result = await payment_manager.verify_transaction(mock_transaction)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_result
```

### Integration Test Example: Order Creation

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_order_creation_flow(client, test_user, test_product):
    # Arrange
    user_id = test_user.telegram_id
    product_id = test_product.id
    quantity = 2
    
    # Act
    async with client.conversation(user_id) as conv:
        await conv.send_message(f"/order {product_id} {quantity}")
        response = await conv.get_response()
        
        # Navigate to checkout
        await conv.send_message("/checkout")
        checkout_response = await conv.get_response()
    
    # Assert
    assert "Order created successfully" in response.text
    assert "Proceed to payment" in checkout_response.text
    
    # Verify database
    with SessionLocal() as db:
        order = db.query(Order).filter(
            Order.buyer_id == test_user.id,
            Order.product_id == product_id
        ).first()
        assert order is not None
        assert order.quantity == quantity
```

## 13. Conclusion

This testing plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensure the quality, security, and performance of the Telegram Chain Store Bot. By implementing this plan, we can identify and address issues early in the development process, resulting in a more robust and reliable application.

Regular review and updates to this plan are recommended as the application evolves and new features are added.
